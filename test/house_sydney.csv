My name's Laura, I'm in my late twenties and I currently reside a couple of hours west of Sydney (although I have lived in Sydney before). I've just recently gotten out of a toxic/abusive relationship and am trying to heal, and am looking to relocate and start fresh. However, I feel I need some help, and I am sucking it up and asking for said help and putting my faith in human kindness for a change. I would be happy living almost anywhere in Sydney including the Blue Mountains. I currently work part-time in retail and have 5 years experience in the industry. However my real passion lies with animals, and I am hoping to start a TAFE course in Veterinary Nursing this year, ideally whilst also working. A traineeship in vet nursing would be tops but a job in any industry would do as long as I can support myself and hopefully study, eventually if not straight away. I own a car but street parking/having to park a little ways away from the house is totally fine with me, and I'm sure I'll take advantage of public transport. It's just myself and my little elderly, blind, mini lop house bunny. He's litter-trained and stays inside due to his blindness, however because he is blind he has a tendency to spill a bit of his water occasionally bless his heart, so hardwood or tiled flooring would be best so I can easily spot clean/lay down something to catch spillages. In a houseshare situation he would happily stay in my bedroom in a large enclosed pen while I'm not home/taking him for supervised outside adventures, although he loves being around people and kissing their feet! I understand having a pet isn't ideal in this situation, but he is my responsibility and I love him dearly therefore non-negotiable. I'm an extremely clean, tidy and responsible person. Happy to keep to myself and do my own thing or form bonds with people and socialise, whatever works best for the people I'm around. I'm not really even asking for any specific type of help... Whether it be advice (I likely need that the most), job opportunities, a room, a new mate. I just need to figure out how to relocate smoothly and land on my feet. I could pay rent for about a month while looking for work, and am also happy to offer any extra services like cleaning, or whatever else you can think of, to help out until I'm fully financially stable.

The furniture and kitchen equipment is 'share house hodge podge' but there is a current low intensity exercise underway to upgrade that. A scanpan cookware set was acquired in the boxing day sales :) The Housies We are two old friends in our mid 30s and have been living together, in this house, for almost a decade. One of us lives in Brisbane half the week but when he is here works 9 to 6-7ish and is often out after work. He runs a wholesale travel agency but does limited other running, almost likes fantasy sports more than reality sports and has devised a remote fish feeding apparatus (""hey if you're home can you please feed the fish"") (by the way we have some fish). The other of us lives here the whole week, with 8-7ish hours and is home most evenings. He is a tax lawyer who gets excitement from minor bargains and when the bus arrival and ferry departure times marry up. By the way, that is to say that he is easily excitable as opposed to having mundane interests. He is also the brawn of the remote fish feeding apparatus. We both grew up in Sydney. The Atmos' We are both friendly and easy going and usually up for a chat, but if you're looking for ready made besties for a spontaneous mid week outing this isn't the house for you (not any more at least). Given the location the house can be a bit of a rendezvous point for our common friends, mainly for the occasional board game or football match, but usually it's just our girlfriends that provide the spice (one very rarely given she lives in Brisbane too). The Deal $350 per week (paid fortnightly) gets you the room and a fortnightly cleaner but not your internet or power, which is around $15-20/week on top but paid when the bills come quarterly. We also ask for an $850 bond. The room is available from the 9th of January.

The master bedroom also comes with the car space in the garage. It is spacious enough for a couple and the last two lots of tenants have been couples. The apartment is at the back of property and opens out onto a huge common back yard (it is the only apartment that has direct access so is scarcely used by others - feel free to grow your herbs/plants out there). It was renovated in 2013 and is of an excellent living standard with dishwasher, oven and other amenities. It has an open plan living/dining area and a spacious kitchen with lots of bench space. There is a separate laundry attached to the 1-car garage and a washing machine and dryer provided. The apartment complex also includes off-street visitor parking. The apartment is located in a really convenient location half way between Marrickville and Dulwich Hill. It is 10 minutes walk to either Dulwich Hill (including new light rail station) or Marrickville Train Station, and 5 mins to buses travelling to the city (412, 422, 426 or 428). 10 mins walk to thriving Marrickville shops with lots of great cafes and all groceries and services you'll need. You can walk to the Marrickville markets at the Addison Road centre on Sundays. Though it is close to everything it is also off the main streets so is nice and peaceful. No traffic noise at all. The place is fully furnished except for your bedroom. The bedroom has a large double door built in wardrobe. All kitchen things are all provided so the place will be perfect for someone who doesn't want to have to buy a whole lot of stuff. The majority of photos of the apartment are current.

My name is Sandra, my 8 year old son and lil toy cavoodle dog live in Bondi Junction near the police station (10min walk to BJ train, 10min bus to Bronte beach).

The deal- furnished room (bed, desk, wardrobe with big window), Wifi, electricity, Netflix cleaning products paid for in return for help 3 nights a week and a bit of cleaning. We have had this arrangment for 7 years and am very aware of not crossing boundaries and not asking for help outside of our agreement, happy to pass on referals from past housemates. Our current housemate has been with us for over a year but has been offered a job interstate, hence not a lot of time before she goes. I work full time and also a second job, i require someone to pick up my son on Tues & Fri pm by 6pm (school is two doors down) , take home- do homework, make dinner, put to bed and stay home, I will be home quite late from work (you would prob be in bed). Plus one other night that we agree on during the week. I can be flexible for occasional changes to these shifts with a bit of notice, and possibly could change the tues to mon or fri to sat for the right person. I ask that you do the dishes daily, garbage & recycling as needed then once a week a house clean to include vacum, mopping, dusting, clean bathroom, clean kitchen otherwise we live as flatmates. Happy for you to have someone over when not taking care of my son, I am (40 years old) super chilled, love a glass of wine, very easy going- same for my son, he is very good, no trouble (honestly i cant even say if i have ever had to yell at him), plus our Cavoodle Ruffy who loves a cuddle and walk if you like.

There's a swimming pool which is great in the summer and we often have drinks and parties there with friends. We're two female young professionals looking for a housemate for our third bedroom! We've lived in our sunny apartment in Bondi for the last two years, and absolutely love living so close to the ocean. We love the Bondi lifestyle and endless summer. You can find us in the ocean most weekends, taking a dip or surfing, even in the middle of winter. In Summer we spend most weekends at the beach, drinking aperol, brunching, and hanging out with friends. On Sunday nights you can find us at North Bondi Diggers, which is Bondi's best kept secret. We both work full-time in the city and are generally pretty quiet during the week, either cooking at home or hitting the gym. On weekends we're very social and love going out, discovering new theatre and movies, dancing, wine tasting, cooking, book club and travelling. Clare Works in human rights. Addicted to salsa. Learning Spanish. Loves travel, musical theatre and going out. Bea Works in solar energy.
